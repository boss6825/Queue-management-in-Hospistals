## Introduction

Modern hospitals need efficient systems to manage patient queues and appointments. This backend project provides a robust API for:
- Registering patients into queues.
- Updating queue statuses in real time.
- Integrating with hospital systems for notifications and updates.

By automating the queue management process, the system helps reduce delays and improve the overall patient experience.

## Features

- **Patient Registration:** Quickly add patients to the queue.
- **Real-time Updates:** Monitor and update queue status dynamically.
- **Queue Prioritization:** Manage patient priority based on different criteria.
- **Authentication & Security:** Uses JWT for secure authentication.
- **File Uploads:** Supports file handling with `express-fileupload` and Cloudinary integration.
- **Scalability:** Built with modular design principles for easy expansion.

## Technologies Used

- **Node.js & Express.js:** Primary framework for building RESTful API endpoints.
- **MongoDB & Mongoose:** Database management for storing patient and queue data.
- **JWT (jsonwebtoken):** Authentication and authorization.
- **Cloudinary:** Cloud-based file storage integration.
- **bcrypt:** Secure password hashing.
- **CORS & Cookie-parser:** Enables cross-origin requests and cookie handling.
- **dotenv:** Manages environment variables.
